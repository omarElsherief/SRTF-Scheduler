# 🚀 SRTF Scheduler

A simple GUI-based Python application that simulates the **Shortest Remaining Time First (SRTF)** CPU scheduling algorithm.

---

## 📋 Overview

The **SRTF Scheduler** is a preemptive CPU scheduling algorithm that always picks the process with the shortest remaining burst time to execute next. This implementation provides a user-friendly graphical interface to visualize the scheduling process.
